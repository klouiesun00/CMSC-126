			  <h3>The Tower of Nero by Rick Riordan</h3>
			  <p>Review by Shannon</p>
			  <p>The Tower of Nero is the last installment of Riordan's series, The Trials of Apollo. I've been reading Riordan's books ever since I picked up "The Lightning Thief" 5 years ago, and he never disappoints. Apollo's charismatic personality was not lost in the gripping pages of the book and his character development was written so endearingly that you can't help but to cheer him on. This book wrapped up the series nicely, and I wouldn't expect anything less from Rick Riordan. 10/10!</p>

			  <h3>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn</h3>
			  <p>Review by Lisa B.</p>	
			  <p>This book was just way too much fun – and I mean that in a good way. I’m taking a leisurely drive down the garden path of the story, when BAM – right in the middle it makes a u-turn and we are on the damn highway doing 90 miles an hour (commonly referred to as a plot twist). Sweet Mother of Mercy! There is not much to say without the risk of giving up some detail that’s best left secret. Soooo many time I wanted to just take one little peek at the end to see what happens to Nick and Amy. But I didn’t. I survived the heart pounding suspense and made it to the end of a very satisfying read. I must, must must check out more books by Ms. Flynn.</p>

			  <h3>The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck</h3>
			  <p>Review by Dem</p>
			  <p>The story is absorbing and exquisitely written. A memorable classic that is a must for any book club or readers who enjoy well written historical fiction novels. I think the characters are beautifully imagined and the story flows from beginning to end. A novel that educates the reader about China, the Chinese people and their traditions and customs. This is a novel that can be read and re-read and still the reader will never tire of its message and characters. A great discussion novel and a book sits proudly on my real life book shelf.</p>

			  <h3>Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami</h3>
			  <p>Review by Yulia</p>
			  <p>How this book became one of Murakami's most famous and popular baffles me. In fact, when asked about it in an interview, Murakami himself said that he was puzzled by its popularity and that it really isn't what he wants to be known for. What can I say? There's too little of the characters that do spark my interest and much too much of the depressive girlfriend and her kooky friend at the mental institution. The worst thing about this book's popularity is that it may be some readers' introduction to Murakami, which would very likely lead them to form a negative opinion of him and not care to explore his other works, which is just awful. This book should come with a warning: "Not recommended for pregnant women, may be carcinogenic, and not representative of Murakami's great genius."</p>

			  <h3>Twilight by Stephanie Meyer</h3>
			  <p>Review by Natty</p>
			  <p>Meyer is not a bad writer. She has the ability to string words together. Unfortunately, she lacks any kind of flair. There was no original description; no truly evocative language. Twilight reads like Meyer has read a lot of mediocre novels and regurgitated the same kind of language onto the page. There is just nothing exciting to the language. The dialogue is awful: not only uninspiring and lacking in wit, but... it's all the same! There's no difference in speech patterns to the characters; no awareness of personal tics. The characterization is wafer-thin. The plotting is terrible: the novel trundles along at a slow pace for 250 pages and then Meyer seems to suddenly realize she needs a climax and the gears shift abruptly and the reader is caught up in a series of ridiculous contrivances that set up Meyer's final set-piece. This is such a profoundly antifeminist novel. And it's funny, because I think Meyer has no idea that it's antifeminist.</p>

			  <h3>Fifty Shades of Grey by EL James</h3>
			  <p>Review by Mel</p>
			  <p>Garbage. Absolutely horrifying, utter trash. A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published? Every single book store in Sydney is promoting this tripe, claiming it to be some kind of awesome romance novel. Are you absolutely shitting me? There is nothing romantic at all about this 'book'. And I don't mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin' thing. An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its' descendants. You know what they say, you can polish a turd, but it will still be a turd.</p>

			<div class="content">
			  <h3>The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown</h3>
			  <p>Review by JG Keely</p>	
			  <p>A thriller devoid of pacing or exciting language. A mystery devoid of clues, foreshadowing, or facts. A tell-all of half-truths based upon a forged document written by a schizophrenic conman. A character-driven modern novel devoid of character. The second draft of Angels and Demons. Page-turning action thanks to the literary equivalent of pulling out at the moment of orgasm. A spiritual awakening built on new-age conspiracy theory. This book is many things, and none of them good, new, or interesting. However, it is an excellent litmus test for idealistic delusion.</p>

			  <h3>Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden</h3>
			  <p>Review by Liz</p>
			  <p>Like eating fancy dessert at a gourmet restaurant, Memoirs of a Geisha is beautiful, melts lightly off the tongue and will be forgotten shortly after it's done. The language is strikingly lovely, and Golden paints a remarkable picture of a time and place. If you're looking to learn something deep about the psychology of Japanese culture, or meet nuanced characters, then I'd steer you elsewhere. The story only skims the top of the more complicated aspects of a Japan in decline, focusing mostly on a genteel lifestyle that probably seems more appealing from the outside. There's a way in which the book, written by a man and a westerner, is slightly fetishistic, but less so than you might imagine.</p>

			  <h3>The Casual Vacancy by JK Rowling</h3>
			  <p>Review by Mitch</p>
			  <p>The Casual Vacancy is as steeped in reality as the Harry Potter books are removed from it. There's nothing fantastical about the story - it's simple and plain, told by holding nothing back. The characterization in this book is simply mind-blowing. Each and every one of the characters is so very real (I know this word's been thrown around a lot, but seriously, there's no other way to describe them) and has such depth! Through the course of the book, they are all ripped apart, dissected with unflinching honesty and laid bare for the readers to see. There are very few likable characters in the book, whom we can root for and hope that things work out for them eventually, but all of them end up earning our sympathies in the end.</p>

			  <h3>The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins</h3>
			  <p>Review by Wendy</p>
			  <p>4.5 stars Everyone in this book is absolutely terrible, and as a result, this book is a masterpiece in character study and development. It's also a well-written, precisely plotted psychological thriller, and deftly sketches one unreliable narrator after another. I guessed the culprit not too far into the book, but that didn't spoil my reading experience at all, particularly because the author drops so many diverting and convincing red herrings into the story. I think it's also interesting that the central character, Rachel, challenges readers to think about how much we assume about--and pre-judge--other people based on our limited knowledge of them. To feel pity, disgust, frustration, compassion, and so much more for one character is a rare thing.</p>
